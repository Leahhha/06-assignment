# 06-assignment
Design:

Nowadays, people have more and more scheduled things to do, it would be a funthing to randomly get small tasks and followed it for fun.

I decide to use this Pushover app to automatically send notifications to users every 2 hours.


New knowledge: 

Math.random(): This function in JavaScript generates a random floating-point number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). In other words, it produces a random number from 0 (inclusive) to less than 1 (exclusive).

Math.floor(): This function is used to round a number down to the nearest integer. When you pass the result of Math.random() * 9 to Math.floor(), it will round the random floating-point number to the nearest integer between 0 and 8.

require('fs'): In Node.js, require is a function used to include modules. Here, you are requiring the built-in 'fs' module, which provides methods for interacting with the file system, such as reading and writing files, creating directories, and more.

var fs = ...: This line is assigning the fs object to a variable named fs. By doing this, you can now use the fs object to access the functionality provided by the 'fs' module in your code.

Challenges:

The most challenging thing is somehow the cron.schedule

The first field (0) represents the minute and specifies that the cron job should run at the 0th minute of the hour.
The second field (*/2) represents every 2 hours for the hour field.
The other fields (* * * *) are left as wildcards, meaning "every day of the month, every month, and every day of the week."
